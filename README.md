# Moving-Platforms
Total solution for 2D and 3D games; lets platforms move along a path with custom editor tools to edit paths and will work in any project wtihout the need for any other scripts other than your own movement/jump scripts.
Visit my YouTube channel for a video explaining how these scripts work and how to set them up in your project: https://youtu.be/51U0FinRgTk
